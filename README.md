# Hungarian Algorithm in C

This code returns the sum of the lowest cost way to assign jobs.
The input should be placed in argv[1] as follows:
 - first line the number of people.
 - the following lines the matrix describing the cost of a job for each person on a line.

If you want to find the assignment of person -> job you need to look in the get_sum function, that is called at the end of the algorithm.

(Added an example in input.txt)

```bash
make
./main name_of_the_input_file
```
