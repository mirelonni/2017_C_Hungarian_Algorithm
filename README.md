#Hungarian Algorithm in C

This code returns the sum of the lowest cost way to assign jobs.
The input should be placed in argv[1] as follows:
 - first line the number of people.
 - the following lines the matrix describing the cost of a job for each person on a line.

(Added an example in input.txt)

```bash
make
./main name_of_the_input_file
```
